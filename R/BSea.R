#' @usage data(BSea)
#' @format A data frame containing five columns and three rows. First column indicates a type of dates constituting each of four samples stored in the other columns. Rows correspond to (in descending order): sample collection date (in calendar years AD/BC), radiocarbon date of the sample and its standard deviation. Column names indicate sample identification codes, which is further used for sample identification.
#' @source Data were published in McNeely et al, 2006 and available at CHRONO Marine Reservoir Database (http://calib.qub.ac.uk/marine/).
