Description: This package enables computation of the regional correction factor of 14C age offset in marine-derived samples (Delta R). This is possible with the recently established ?marine13? calibration curve and the "BchronCalibrate" function from the "Bchron" package. The algorithm of Delta R computation includes four steps: measure radiocarbon age of a marine sample; identify its true age; compute its modeled radiocarbon age corresponding to the true age; and finally calculate the difference between its measured and modeled radiocarbon ages. This package has functions that compute Delta R with three methods: by using marine samples with known collection dates (before 1950s), usually molluscan shells from museum collections, (function dr_shell()); by measuring other radioactive isotopes, mainly uranium-thorium (230Th/234U), ratio (dr_pair() function and the "pair" method in the dr_df() function); and finally by using a pair of coeval samples, one being marine and the other terrestrial (dr_pair() function and the ?pair? method for the dr_df() function as well). Usually such samples originate from archaeological sites where the context, in which paired samples were found, is taken as a guarantee of their synchronicity.
